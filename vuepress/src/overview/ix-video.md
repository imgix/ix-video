# 📹 ix-video

**ix-video** is a web component that makes it quick and easy to use our powerful video processing and delivery platform inside your web application.

The component is built on top of the [video.js](https://videojs.com) library, which is a free, open source, cross-platform video player library for the web that is used by millions of developers.

Features:

[🏎️ Fast, High-Quality Streaming By Default](#basic-usage)

[🎨 Fully customizable out of the box](#customization)

[📝 Support for all HTML5 video formats](#type)

[⚙️ Powerful configuration options](#video-js-configuration)

## Setup

::: tip Note

**HLS** is the default playback format for [imgix video](https://blog.imgix.com/2021/12/15/streaming-video-part-3-http-live-streaming) and the `ix-video` player.

HLS video playback leverages adaptive bitrate streaming **(ABS)** technology to deliver the smooth video quality in the quickest time possible.
:::

## Basic Usage

First import the component:

```js
import {IxVideo} from '@imgix/ix-video';
```

We recommend you do this in the root of your application so that the custom elements are registered for the entire application.

Then, use the `ix-video` custom element and set the `source` attribute to the source URL of the HLS playlist:

<<< @/src/.vuepress/components/video/hls.vue

And you're ready to go 🎉.

<video-hls></video-hls>

### React

React can render custom elements (Web Components), but it has [trouble](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/#react) passing React props to custom element properties and event listeners.

We recommend using a wrapper like [@lit-labs/react](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/react#readme) to wrap the custom element in a React component that passes props and synthetic events to the custom element.

Here's an example of how to wrap the custom element in a React component:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import {createComponent} from '@lit-labs/react';
import {IxVideo} from '@imgix/ix-video';

// wrap the component to
export const Video = createComponent(React, 'ix-video', IxVideo, {
  onSeeked: 'seeked',
});

// use the component
<Video
  controls
  source="https://assets.imgix.video/videos/girl-reading-book-in-library.mp4"
  onSeeked={(e) => console.log(e)}
/>;
```

### Vue

Vue has great support for Web Components, so you can use the component in your Vue application without any additional steps.

```html
<script setup>
  import {IxVideo} from '@imgix/ix-video';
  import {ref} from 'vue';
</script>
<script>
  export default {
    methods: {
      warn(message, event) {
        console.warn(message, event.detail);
      },
    },
  };
</script>

<template>
  <div class="App">
    <ix-video
      controls
      source="https://assets.imgix.video/videos/girl-reading-book-in-library.mp4"
      @error="(event) => warn('error:', event)"
    ></ix-video>
  </div>
</template>
```

You will need to signal to the Vue compiler that this component is a custom element by adding the following:

```js
//vue.config.js
module.exports = {
  chainWebpack: config => {
    config.module
      .rule('vue')
      .use('vue-loader')
      .tap(options => ({
        ...options,
        compilerOptions: {
          // treat any tag that starts with ix- as custom elements
          isCustomElement: (name) => name.startsWith('ix-'),
        }
      })
    )
  }
```

Or if you're using Vite, you can add the following to your `vite.config.js`:

```js
//vite.config.js
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue';
import {defineConfig} from 'vite';

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    vue({
      template: {
        compilerOptions: {
          isCustomElement: (name) => name.startsWith('ix-'),
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Attributes

The component is designed to mimic the `<video>` tag [API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#attributes) as closely as possible. So most of the [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#attributes) that are supported by the `<video>` tag are also supported by the `<ix-video>` tag.

You can find a list of the supported `<video>` element attributes [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video)

Additionally, the following non-standard attributes are used:

| Attribute    |         Description          |           Default Value |
| ------------ | :--------------------------: | ----------------------: |
| `data-setup` |  video.js specific options   |                    `{}` |
| `fixed`      |  Turns on/off auto-resizing  |                 `false` |

| `type`       |     The video media type     | `application/x-mpegURL` |

### controls

> default: `true`

Show/hide the player controls.

### dataSetup

> default: `{}`

Set video.js specific options. See [video.js documentation](https://videojs.com/guides/options/) for examples.

### height

Set the video player's height. If `fixed` is set to `true`, the player will not automatically resize to fit inside the container's dimensions.

```html
<ix-video
  source="https://assets.imgix.video/videos/girl-reading-book-in-library.mp4"
  height="200"
  fixed="true"
  controls
>

```

<ix-video
source="https://assets.imgix.video/videos/girl-reading-book-in-library.mp4"
height="200"
fixed="true"
controls

> </ix-video>

### poster

> default: undefined

The video's poster image URL. The `poster` attribute will automatically try to resize the poster image to fit the video player's dimensions.

```html
<ix-video
  controls
  poster="https://sdk-test.imgix.net/amsterdam.jpg"
  source="https://assets.imgix.video/videos/girl-reading-book-in-library.mp4"
>
</ix-video>
```

<ix-video
controls
poster="https://sdk-test.imgix.net/amsterdam.jpg"
source="https://assets.imgix.video/videos/girl-reading-book-in-library.mp4"

> </ix-video>

### source

> default: undefined

The video's source URL. Should be used in combination with `type` attribute when the `source` is not an HLS source.

### type

> default: application/x-mpegURL

The media type of the video. Supports standard `video` media types and **HLS** media types.

```html
<ix-video
  controls
  preload="none"
  poster="https://sdk-test.imgix.net/amsterdam.jpg"
  source="https://assets.imgix.net/videos/girl-reading-book-in-library.mp4"
  type="video/mp4"
>
</ix-video>
```

<ix-video
controls
preload="none"
poster="https://sdk-test.imgix.net/amsterdam.jpg"
source="https://assets.imgix.net/videos/girl-reading-book-in-library.mp4"
type="video/mp4"

> </ix-video>

### width

> default: undefined

The width of the video player. When `fixed` is set to `true`, the player will not automatically resize to fit inside the container's dimensions.

```html
<ix-video
  source="https://assets.imgix.video/videos/girl-reading-book-in-library.mp4"
  width="200"
  controls
>
</ix-video>
```

<ix-video
source="https://assets.imgix.video/videos/girl-reading-book-in-library.mp4"
width="200"
controls

> </ix-video>

## Customization

The `ix-video` player uses [video-js](https://videojs.com/getting-started) and its default [skin](https://videojs.com/getting-started/#skinning) to style the player. Therefore, you can can target any of the video-js components and customize their appearance.

For example, if you want to change big play button color to red, you can do it by adding the following CSS class to the `ix-video` component:

<<< @/src/.vuepress/components/video/styles.vue#snippet{4-13,22}

Now, on first load, the player's big play button will look like this:

<video-styles></video-styles>

## Advanced Usage

### Restricting the player's size

You can restrict the video player's dimensions to a specific size one of two ways:

1. by styling its container.
2. by specifying the `width` and `height` attributes and
3. by adding the `fixed` attribute

<<< @/src/.vuepress/components/video/container.vue#snippet{3,10,15-17}

The `fixed` attribute will force the player to be a fixed size. This is useful if you want to use the player in a layout that has a fixed width.

Without the `fixed` attribute, the player will be responsive to the size of the container it is placed in.

You can resize this window to see the difference.

<video-container></video-container>

### Video.js configuration

`ix-video` accepts most of the `data-setup`
[options](https://videojs.com/guides/options) supported by video.js. This allows
you to customize the player's capabilities and behavior beyond what's available
to native `<video>` element.

For example, you can add playback speed support to the player by adding the
following data-setup option:

```html
<ix-video
  controls
  source="https://assets.imgix.video/videos/girl-reading-book-in-library.mp4"
  data-setup='{"playbackRates": [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]}'
></ix-video>
```

Your video will now display the defined playback rate options on the bottom
right-hand side of the playback controls.

<ix-video
controls
source="https://assets.imgix.video/videos/girl-reading-book-in-library.mp4"
data-setup='{"playbackRates": [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]}'

> </ix-video>
